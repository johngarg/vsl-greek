Today in class we talked about [Greek
verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_grammar#Verbs). We talked
about how there are eight tenses in Greek, given by a combination of verbal
aspect (indicating duration) and time (indicating past, present or future).

|                | Past        | Present    | Future        |
|----------------|:-------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| **Continuous** | έ<span style="color:blue">γραφ</span>α <br> *παρατατικός*   | <span style="color:blue">γραφ</span>ω <br> *ενεστώτας*    | θα <span style="color:blue">γραφ</span>ω <br> *εξακολουθητικός μέλλοντας*     |
| **Simple** | έ<span style="color:red">γραψ</span>α <br> *αόριστος* | --- | θα <span style="color:red">γραψ</span>ω <br> *συνοπτικός μέλλοντας* |
| **Completed**  | είχα γράψει <br> *υπερσυντέλικος* | έχω γράψει <br> *παρακείμενος*  | θα έχω γράψει <br> *συντελεσμένος μέλλοντας* |

(Recall that the continuous present is used for the simple present as well.) I
think it's most clear to name the tenses as you see them in the table, with the
combination of aspect and time, *i.e.* continuous past, completed present *etc.*
I've also included the traditional Greek names.

The continuous tenses are formed from the <span style="color:blue">continuous
stem</span>, and the simple ones are formed from the <span
style="color:red">simple stem</span>. The completed tenses are formed with a
combination of the auxiliary verb έχω and the infinitive (always formed from the
simple stem + ει).

You can think about the formation of the simple stem from the continuous stem
with the addition of σ followed by a consonant change, such that

| How/Where is the sound made? | Rule                                                    |
|------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Throat**            | $$\kappa, \gamma, \chi + \sigma \rightarrow \xi$$       |
| **Lips**              | $$ \pi, \beta, \phi + \sigma \rightarrow \psi$$         |
| **Teeth (+ nose)**  | $$\tau, \delta, \theta, \zeta, (\nu) + \sigma \rightarrow \sigma$$ |

These forms are relevant to [first
conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_grammar#First_conjugation)
Greek verbs, *i.e.* verbs that end in -ω. We also briefly touched on [second
conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_grammar#Second_conjugation)
verbs which end in -άω (αγαπάω, γελάω, *etc.*) and -ώ (καλώ, ευχαριστώ, *etc.*).
The simple stem of second conjugation verbs is also formed with the addition of
a σ to the continuous stem, although in this case there is a vowel change:

$$\alpha + \sigma \rightarrow \eta \sigma$$

Like αγαπάω $$\rightarrow$$ αγαπ<span style="color:red">ή</span>σω and ευχαριστώ
$$\rightarrow$$ ευχαριστ<span style="color:red">ή</span>σω.

I made a final point about spelling: noun formation in Greek often happens with
the simple stem. So, for example, <span style="color:blue">η</span>
ευχαρίστ<span style="color:red">η</span>σ<span style="color:blue">η</span>,
<span style="color:blue">η</span> οδήγ<span style="color:red">η</span>σ<span
style="color:blue">η</span>, <span style="color:blue">το</span> γράψιμ<span
style="color:blue">ο</span>, *etc.* Notice that in the case of the nouns formed
from second conjugation verbs, the spelling of the second-last *i* sound makes
sense as an <span style="color:red">η</span>, since this is how the simple stem
is formed.

All of this structure will be duplicated in the [passive
voice](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Modern_Greek/Lesson_04.4#Lesson_4.4:_1st_Conjugation_Passive_Verbs),
which we will discuss in more detail in the future.
