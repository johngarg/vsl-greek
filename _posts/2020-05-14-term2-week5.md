Γεια σας! Καλώς ήρθατε πάλι σε ένα άλλο διαδικτυακό μάθημα!

## VCE

Today we will continue with our work on future plans with a new subtopic:
travel. There is less work than usual because I want to give you time to prepare
for you SAC which will take place next week.
1. **Travel** Read the conversation between κυρία Δήμου and the travel agent
   from chapter 24 of the GCSE I book. The title of the chapter is "Έχω πάει
   στην Αυστρία και στην Αυστραλία". Answer the following questions in Greek:
   1. Ποιες κατηγορίες διακοπών αναφέρονται στο κείμενο;
   2. Ποια είναι η γνώμη της κυρίας Δήμου για τα οργανωμένα ταξίδια; Γιατί έχει την γνώμη αυτή;
   3. Η κυρία Δήμου είναι δραστήριος άνθρωπος. Βρες παραδείγματα από το κείμενο
      υπέρ και κατά της θέσης αυτής. Τί νομίζεις;
   4. Πόσων χρονών νομίζεις ότι είναι η κυρία Δήμου; Υποστήριξε την απάντησή σου με δύο επιχειρήματα. 
  
2. **Vocabulary** I've included a list of relevant vocabulary for this topic [on
   this post](/vsl-greek/planning-vocab/index.html). This also includes some
   vocabulary relevant for the SAC.

3. **Listening comprehension** Complete the listening comprehension tasks from
   [this handout](/vsl-greek/assets/greekexam2005_comp.pdf). There are two
   tasks: answers for [part A](/vsl-greek/assets/greek_text1_2005.mp3) should be
   in English, and for [part B](/vsl-greek/assets/greek_text3_2005.mp3) in
   Greek. The links in the previous sentence are to the audio files. Please scan
   or take a photo of your work for marking. Both tasks are relevant to our
   topic and the SAC.

4. **SAC practice** It goes without saying that you should spend some time
   preparing for the SAC this week. Please email me if you have any questions. I
   would recommend constructing a flow diagram with dot points at the nodes,
   summarising the different ways the conversation might flow. Use this to
   prepare relevant vocabulary and rough phrasing. Please practise with someone
   if you can. 
   
   I'm happy to do a practice SAC with you during the week, but it will need to
   be on a slightly different topic. I think the following scenarios will likely
   cover similar content as the actually SAC:
   
   - **Unit 3** We are friends and disagree about where to go on holidays. You
   want to go to Greece, I don't. We need to resolve our disagreement and come
   to a compromise.
   - **Unit 1** We are friends and are discussing where to go on holidays. Our
   plans are not yet well formulated and we are exploring options for what the
   trip will look like.
   
   We can discuss who would like to do a practice SAC and when it will take
   place in the lesson later today.
      
5. Submit your work for steps 1 and 3 [at this
   link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/DZNOuxnjDRn7a8cmkL0U) before 4:00 PM
   Thursday May 21.

6. Check out [this awesome trailer](/vsl-greek/markos-trailer/index.html) for a
   documentary on the modern reinterpretation of the Rembetika of [Markos
   Vamvakaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markos_Vamvakaris). Think about how
   this ties in with the themes from last week on what it means to respect
   tradition, and modern renditions of traditional Greek urban music. Look out
   for appearances of our friend Mystakidis in the video too!

## Years 9 and 10

Next week we will have our oral conversation test. This week we will wrap up our
theme on personal communication with a topic on everyday life.

1. **Reading comprehension** Read the text titled Μόλις σχολάσω from chapter 10
   of the GCSE I textbook. Answer the questions in box A on the next page of the
   textbook in full sentences.
2. **Everyday routine** Use the [notes from class](), the appropriate parts of
   the reading comprehension exercise, and the model sentences on page 58 of
   chapter 10 of the textbook to narrate a typical day in your life in Greek.
   This should be around 150 words.
3. **Connecting words** Following from the discussion on connecting words,
   complete exercise Η on page 61 of the GCSE I workbook for chapter 10.
4. **Prepare for test** You should spend some time preparing for the short (2-3
   minute) conversational test next week. You should be ready to answer
   questions on
   - School life, e.g.
        - Πες μου για το σχολείο
        - Ποιο είναι το αγαπημένο σου μάθημα, γιατί;
   - Social life, e.g.
        - Πες μου για τον καλύτερό σου φίλο/φίλη
        - Πως γνωριστήκατε;
        - Ποια κοινά σημεία έχετε;
        - Τί κάνετε όταν είστε μαζί;
   - Daily life, e.g.
        - Τί ώρα ξυπνας το πρωί συνήθως; Πόσες ώρες κοιμάσαι;
        - Πως περνάς τον ελεύθερό σου χρόνο;
    
5. Submit your work for steps 1 and 2 [at this
   link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/mZCiVKm7zDtsGlYrJkTM). Self-correct
   your work for step 3 with [these answers](). If you submit your step 2
   paragraph early enough in the week, I can correct it before your test next
   week.
