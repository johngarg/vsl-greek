Γεια σας! Welcome to the first lesson of semester 3!

## VCE

I hope the holidays were relaxing, and congratulations again on completing
units 1/3! 

The rough plan for this term is the following:
- Our last SAC for semester 1 will happen today
- The work for this week will centre around a new (and short) topic on
technology and media
- We will move through this topic quickly, before moving on to our detailed
study topic of migration. This will tie in with the work we did earlier in the
year on Rembetiko as well, and we will revise the parts we need to. As I
mentioned to you last week, this will happen with a new teacher.

This week I would like to start the unit on technology and the media
(τεχνολογία και μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης [MME]). We will be working from chapter
20 in the [GCSE II
book](http://www.ediamme.edc.uoc.gr/diaspora/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=157:nea-ellinika-gia-to-gcse-2&catid=105&Itemid=579&lang=el#pdf).

1. **Reading Comprehension** Read the main chapter text on pages 143 and 144.
   Begin making a glossary of the difficult words you come across, this will be
   helpful in the coming weeks. Answer the questions in the box titled A on
   page 145. Write down some responses for the questions in box B, these will
   be discussed in class next week.
2. **Writing task** Use one of the texts on page 146 as inspiration for an
   essay. I would recommend:
- **Πλεονεκτήματα και μειωνεκτήματα της τεχνολογίας στη ζωή μας** (Pros and
        cons of technology in our lives) Write an approx. 250 word evaluative
or persuasive essay in Greek, either contrasting the benefits and drawbacks of
technology in our lives, or arguing for or against. The texts *Ιοί στα κινητά*,
           *Η τηλεόραση μπορεί να συμβάλει στην παχυσαρκία* and *Το σημείωμα
           της Ιφιγένειας* are relevant here.
- **Imaginative story** Read *Το κινητό τους έσωσε τη ζωή* or *Οι υπηρέτες του
2000* and write an imaginative story based on the text.
3. Don't forget to continue with exam study, please consider adopting one of
the plans for exam revision outlined in [last week's
post](/vsl-greek/term2-week11/index.html). If you would like
to roughly align this with our current topic, here are some exam parts that are
relevant to technology and the media:
- 2017 section 2 part B
- 2006 section 1 part A
- 2002 section 2 part A 
I've not listed writing tasks relevant to technology
and media, since you already have one to do on this topic in task 2.
