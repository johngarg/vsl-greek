# SAC 1: Outcome 3

As mentioned today in class, our first SAC will be outcome 3 (a 250-word
personal piece of writing). The text-type will either be an informal letter or a
journal article so you should prepare for both. 

The SAC will be on **the 12th of March**. I would prefer that we do the SAC in
the period before the break (since you all will be more alert), although I know
it usually takes some time for everyone to arrive from day school.

You will be able to do the SAC without a problem if you have not revised or read
about ρεμπέτικα (our detailed-study topic), although revising some basic things
about the instruments and style of music may give you more content to write
about.
