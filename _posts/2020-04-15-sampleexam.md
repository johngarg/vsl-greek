VCAA recently released the [2020 Greek sample exam](https://vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/greek/2020/greek-sampexam-w.pdf) as well as the [exam specifications](https://vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/greek/2020/greek-written-specs-w.pdf). Recall that the study design has changed this year, and this includes changes to the exam structure. Please look at it carefully and take note of the instructions for each section. I recommend that you should start doing some practice exams from now. You can access all of the previous exams [here](https://vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Greek.aspx). There's little reason to wait until the end of the year, especially if you choose text types for your essay that we've covered in class already.
