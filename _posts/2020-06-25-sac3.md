# SAC 3: Outcome 2

Our third SAC will be outcome 2. This will be an interpretive communication task:

- **Year 12s** A listening and reading comprehension task that pulls together
themes from our topic on the environment. The listening comprehension component
should be answered **in Greek**. You will hear the stimulus three times. There will
be 80 minutes to complete both tasks.

- **Year 11s** A listening and reading comprehension task that pulls together
themes from our topic on the environment. The listening comprehension component
should be answered **in English**. You will hear the stimulus three times. There will
be 80 minutes to complete both tasks.

The SAC will take place on **Thursday July 16**, the first day of term 3. The
SAC will be done in person at Doncaster, since we are set to return to
face-to-face classes by then. The SACs will be marked according to [this
rubric](/vsl-greek/assets/sac3_marking.pdf).
