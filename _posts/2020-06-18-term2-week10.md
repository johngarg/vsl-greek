Γεια σας! We continue this week with our online learning. Please see the tasks
for this week below.

## VCE

This week we are continuing with our topic on the environment. Again, this is
looking towards our SAC which will be a combination of reading and listening
comprehension. I am arranging for us to be able to do this *in person* at VSL.
We will discuss this in more detail in today's lesson.

The VCAA exam timetable came out today, it is
[here](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/administration/Key-dates/Pages/VCE-exam-timetable.aspx).
The Greek exam is on Tuesday December 1.

This week we will continue working from [workset
14](/vsl-greek/assets/GreekUnit3WB2WS14.pdf). As we did last week, please
disregard comments in the workset about assessment.

1. **Listening Comprehension** Complete the listening comprehension exercises 4
   and 6 in workset 14. You will need [this audio
   file](/vsl-greek/assets/GreekUnit3WB2WS14Track_07.mp3) for exercise 4 (use
   the 2010 examiner's report for self-correction here), and [this
   one](/vsl-greek/assets/GreekUnit3WB2WS14Track_08.mp3) for exercise 6.
2. **Reading Comprehension** Complete exercise 5 in the workset, answering the
   questions in Greek. Also complete the reading comprehension task on pages 8
   and 9 of [the 2003 VCAA Greek
   exam](https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/assessment/vce-assessment/past-examinations/Pages/Greek.aspx).
   Mark this using the examiner's report provided on the website.
3. **Vocabulary** Complete exercise 8 and 9 in the workset, this builds more
   environmental specific vocabulary. (self-corrected)

1. **Revision: the imperative mood** Complete the revision exercises 1 and 2 in the workset.
2. **Grammar: simple past tense** In class we will review the simple past tense
   of verbs in the active and mediopassive moods. The latter is discussed in the
