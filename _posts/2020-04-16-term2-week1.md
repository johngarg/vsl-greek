Welcome to online learning!

Every week I'll upload a post like this on Thursday mornings. This post will provide details about the work for you to do before the Zoom meeting the following week, not the one on the same day. In the meeting, we'll discuss the work from last week and at the end I'll run through the content presented here.

I would like to trial the use of a learning app called [Education Perfect](https://epforlearning.com) in the coming week. Please sign up and enter the class code I've sent you in an email.

## VCE

1. **VCAA sample exam** I have uploaded a link to the VCAA Greek sample exam, which was uploaded on their website recently. Please take a look at the post I made about it and familiarise yourself with the new exam structure.
2. **Subjects and adjectives** Continuing in the spirit of the [oral worksheet](/vsl-greek/assets/oral_worksheet.pdf) we have been working with, I would like you to read the letters of Ιφιγένεια and Αντρέας in chapter 3 of the [GCSE II textbook](http://www.ediamme.edc.uoc.gr/diaspora/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=157:nea-ellinika-gia-to-gcse-2&catid=105&Itemid=579&lang=el#pdf). 
- Pay close attention to the way adjectives are used in the texts to colour the language, take note of which ones stand out to you as useful for your own writing. 
- Comparing to page 27 of chapter 3 in the book, can you place which inflectional model they fit in? 
- Take note of which inflectional models you do not feel comfortable with. 
- Complete exercises Ζ and Η on page 23 of the corresponding chapter in the [τετράδιο](http://www.ediamme.edc.uoc.gr/diaspora/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=157:nea-ellinika-gia-to-gcse-2&catid=105&Itemid=579&lang=el#τετράδιο) (workbook).
3. **Oral worksheet** Write careful answers to the questions in the oral worksheet based off the sample responses and the stimuli in the remaining pages of chapter 3 of the textbook linked above. Try and answer each question in at least two different ways, using different vocabulary and active/passive voice for verbs. Have them practised and ready to present orally next class. Note that there is stimulus for answering questions like με τί ασχολείσαι / τί κάνεις στον ελεύθερό σου χρόνο

## Years 9 and 10

We'll be continuing the work building up to our oral test that will coincide with the oral SAC for the VCE students. This will be an oral test in which we have a short conversation about you. This week we'll concentrate on talking about friends.

1. Read the paragraphs of Εύα, Γιώργος and Αλίκη in chapter 2 of the GCSE I book. Answer the three questions on page 15 of the same chapter.

2. In a similar way, write a paragraph (around 100 words) about a friend of yours. Some ideas to get you going:
   - όνομα, ηλικία
   - εμφάνιση και ντύσιμο
   - στοιχεία για τον χαρακτήρα και τη συμπεριφορά του/της
   - τα ενδιαφέροντά του/της
   - τί κάνετε μαζί
   - γιατί πιστεύεις ότι ταιριάζετε;

   Send me a photo over email.

3. [Watch the video on nouns](https://youtu.be/IigRhLxrBac) and complete exercises Δ, E and H in the workbook chapter from the GCSE I book.
